                   <p> <strong>How to plant maize</strong>: <br> Farmers are always on the lookout for ways
                     that they can use to improve their production and yield.
                    The following simple guide will guarantee excellent yields:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Proper land preparation.Land must be well tilled.  Remove grass and weeds
                             as they hinder production of maize.</li>
                        <li>Timely planting at the onset of rains. Yields are negatively affected by late planting</li>
                        <li>Choose appropriate hybrids depending on the altitude of your area</li>
                        <li>Consider appropriate plant population and spacing. Go with 90 by 30 cm, or 90 by 55 cm for low plant population</li>.
                        <li>Liaise with extension officers in your area for a guide on appropriate fertilizer application</li>
                        <li>Weed early to enhance flowering</li>
                        <li>Protect against pests like stalk borer</li>

                  <h2>Sunflower</h2>
                  <p>
                    Sunflower constitutes one of the most important oil crops marketed in Kenya.
                    Its growth habits are either dwarf or tall. The tall varieties which are often local and open
                    pollinated grow up to a height of between 1.5 and 2.4 metres.
                    Their yield is also low as compared to the hybrids. 
                    Examples of these tall varieties are Kenya Fedha and Hungarian white.
                    The optimal annual rainfall for a good crop is between 500 and 750 mm. <br>
                    <strong>Planting</strong>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Soils should be well ploughed and a firm seed bed established.
                        Prepare land early in mid February for early planting between mid March 
                        and April during the long rains and in mid July for planting between Mid August and September</li>
                      <li>Planting should be done immediately after the onset of rains for harvesting to occur in 
                        dry weather as wet weather at that time will rot the seed heads.</li>
                      <li>With a spacing of 75 x 25 -30cm, the seed rate will range between 3 and 4 kg/acre</li>
                      <li>Sunflower needs good fertilization. Use of 60 kg per acre of D.A.P (Diammonium Phosphate)
                         or 3 tonnes per acre of well rotted farmyard manure or compost</li>
                      <li>Thinning should also be done to one plant per hole around the
                            same period as weeding but when the soil is wet.</li>
                      <li>Hand harvesting is done when the heads turn deep yellow. Cut the head, 
                        spike it upside down on the stalk or thresh and sun-dry.</li>
                      <li>To dry them,psread the seeds on a clean canvas and leave to
                         dry for 3-5 days or until the seeds become light.</li>
                    </ul>

                  <p>
                      The seedbed for planting dry beans must be deep, level and firm.
                      This ensures better contact between seed and soil, increasing moisture absorption. <br>
                      <strong>Planting:</strong>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Place seeds 2,5cm to 5cm below the soil surface. </li>
                        <li>Dry beans struggle to compete with weeds. Early weed control is thus very important.</li>
                        <li>Remove all weeds mechanically during seedbed preparation, and repeat with a tiller 
                            between the rows when necessary up to the flowering stage. <br>This will also loosen the 
                            soil and improve water penetration</li>
                        <li>To prevent shattering, beans should be pulled when the moisture content of the pods is 
                          temporarily higher – that is, early in the morning before the dew has evaporated.</li>

                       </ul>
                      <p><strong>Harvesting</strong></p>
                      Dry beans are ready for harvesting when the moisture content drops to 15% (the ideal) or 16%.
                      Seeds may split during threshing when the moisture content is less than 12%. 
                      Such seeds are rejected by canners and seed companies.
